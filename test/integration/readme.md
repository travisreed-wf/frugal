# Frugal - Cross language test suite

Used to verify that each supported transport and protocol works as expected
across all supported languages.

## To Run:
##### In Skynet:

Push to any Smithy enabled Frugal fork.  Skynet will execute tests with using
the current Frugal branch (not the latest release).

##### Locally:
Setup [skynet-cli](https://github.com/workiva/skynet-cli) and run `skynet run
cross-local`. The 'cross' configuration (which is executed in Skynet) uses
Smithy build artifacts whereas the 'cross-local' configuration does not
require these to execute the test suite.  'cross-local' will only execute
tests using Frugal code generation.

### Debugging
Errors are reported to unexpected_failures.log (under "Artifacts" on a Skynet
run or under "Test Artifacts" at the end of the logs in skynet-cli).  This log
will enable you to see exactly where tests are failing.  This log also contains
the command (and directory where the command was run) that was used to run each
configuration near the top of the pair. These commands can be used in local
debugging - no need to run skynet-cli or push a new commit.  _Note: If you do
 not via the test suite, you will need to manually take care of setup, such
 as re-generating code, before executing. You will also need to have gnats
 running locally._


### General Overview
The major components of this test suite include:
* frugalTest.frugal IDL file
* test definitions in tests.json
* Go cross runner
* language specific clients/servers

##### frugalTest.frugal
The IDL file from which test cases are generated.  _This is where tests are
defined and described. Look here if you aren't sure what a particular test
should be doing._

The FrugalTest service defines every type of value (int, string, map, list,
map of maps, etc.) that could be sent across the wire.  Please contact Jacob
Moss (jacob.moss@workiva.com) if you believe there are additional test cases
that should be added.

The Events scope is used for verifying pub/sub.

##### tests.json
This json file contains a listing of each supported language, client, server,
transport, and protocol, as well as the bash command required to run a
configuration.

##### Go cross runner
The Go cross runner is responsible for parsing the json test definitions,
determining the valid client/server pairs, running each pair with a unique
subject, and recording the results.  Test logs are tar'ed in test_logs.tar.gz
using the format : `clientName-serverName_transport_protocol_role.log`.
Failures are added to unexpected_failures.og (both client and server side logs).

##### Language specific clients/servers
Each client/server:

* accepts the following flags:
  * port (used as the NATS subject, 5 digit random number when called by the
  cross runner)
    * defaults to 9090 for manual testing
  * transport
    * defaults to nats (where supported, otherwise http)
  * protocol
    * defaults to binary
* calls/handles every case defined in the frugalTest service
* implements middleware (where supported) to
  * log
    * name of each RPC
    * arguments each RPC is called with
    * return value of the RPC
  * verify middleware works as expected
* throws a non-zero exit code when an error is encountered

For publish/subscribe testing, servers are set up as a subscriber and publish
an acknowledgement upon receipt of a publish.  Clients act as a publisher
(subscribing to the acknowledgement) and verify that an acknowledgement is
returned after publishing.

### Contributing
Follow Frugal's contribution [guidelines](https://github.com/Workiva/frugal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Any tests that are added should be added to all languages (where applicable).


### Known Issues

* 	Binary calls across json protocol are serialized differently between go
and java.  [#412](https://github.com/Workiva/frugal/issues/412)
